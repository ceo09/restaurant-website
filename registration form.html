    <h1>Registration Form</h1>
    <p>Please fill out this form with the required information</p>
    <form action=''>
        <fieldset>
            <label>Enter Your First Name: <input type="text" required /></label>
            <label>Enter Your Last Name: <input type="text" required /></label>
            <label>Enter Your Email: <input type="email" required /></label>
            <!--Certain type attribute values come with built-in form validation. For example, type="email" requires 
            that the value be a valid email address.

            Add custom validation to the password input element, by adding a
             minlength attribute with a value of 8. Doing so prevents inputs of 
             less than 8 characters being submitted.-->
             <!--With type="password" you can use the pattern attribute to define a regular expression that
             the password must match to be considered valid.

             Add a pattern attribute to the password input element to require the input match: [a-z0-5]{8,}

              The above is a regular expression which matches eight or more lowercase letters or the digits 0 to 5. 
               Then, remove the minlength attribute, and try it out.-->
            <label>Create a New Password: <input type="password" minlength="8" required /></label>
          </fieldset>
        <fieldset>
            <!--Users will be allowed to choose either a Personal Account or Business Account.

            To do this, within each of the first two label elements, add one input element with type="radio".-->
            <label>
                <input class="inline" type="radio" name="account-type"> Personal Account
            </label>

                <input class="inline" type="radio" name="account-type"> Business Account
            </label>
            <!--For the terms and conditions, add an input with a type of checkbox to
                the third label element. Also, as we do not want users to sign up, without
                having read the terms and conditions, make it required-->
             <label>
                <!--You only want one radio input to be selectable at a time. However,
                     the form does not know the radio inputs are related.

                      To relate the radio inputs, give them the same name attribute with a value of account-type.
                     Now, it is not possible to select both radio inputs at the same time.-->
                <input name="checkbox" type="checkbox" required> I accept the<a href="#"> terms and conditions</a> 
             </label>
        </fieldset>
        <!--Moving on to the final fieldset. What if you wanted to allow a user to upload a profile picture?

             Well, the input type file allows just that. Add a label with the text Upload a profile picture: ,
          and add an input accepting a file upload.-->
        <fieldset>
            <label> Upload a profile picture: 
                <input type="file">
                <!--Add another label after the first, with the text Input your age (years): . 
                  Then, nest an input with the type of number.

                    As we do not want users under the age of 13 to register, add a min 
                    attribute to the input with a value of 13. Also, we can probably assume users over the age of 120 will not register; add a max attribute with a value of 120.

                      Now, if someone tries to submit the form with values outside of the range, 
                      a warning will appear, and the form will not submit. Give it a try.-->
                      <label>Input your age (years):
                        <input type="number" min="13" max="120">
                        <!--Adding a dropdown to the form is easy with the select element.
                           The select element is a container for a group of option elements, and 
                           the option element acts as a label for each dropdown option. Both elements 
                           require closing tags.

                        Start, by adding a select element below the two label elements. Then, nest 5 option 
                        elements within the select element.-->
